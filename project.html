			<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
				<li><h3>Clearing Traffic Signals for the Ambulance</h3>
					<p>The main aim of this project is to clear the way for the ambulances in case of heavy traffic. For doing this, a Wi-Fi ESP module integrated with arduino is attached to the dashboard of the ambulance as well as to the traffic light system. In the Wi-Fi module a particular distance can be set to ensure that an alarm buzzer arises whenever the ambulance comes within the range and the signal changes immediately to GREEN. An alarm buzzer can also be attached to the traffic light system, so that transporters can provide way for the ambulance so that it can be easy for the drivers to reach the patients to the nearby hospitals at the right time. This will be useful for saving lives of patients in emergency situations. This device can be incorporated with ambulance to avoid the traffic in emergency situations.</p>

                <li><h3>Counsellors Info</h3>
			    <p>The Storing and retrieval of data for analysis is a difficult job. To automate and simplify counselling details and to create a view of the details is our primary aim. The data are displayed in the form of tables. Retrieving through our project is made easy.</p>
			    </li>
                <li><h3>Smart and Dynamic Timetable Management System</h3>
			    <p>Time Table Scheduling is a well-known NP-hard problem which can be solved using Genetic Algorithm. It a typical scheduling problem that appears to be a tedious job in every academic institute once or twice a year. In earlier days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group of people. But it takes a lot of effort and time. Preparing timetables is one of the most complex and error-prone tasks. Timetabling is the task of creating a timetable while satisfying some constraints. There are basically two types of constraints, soft constraints and hard constraints. Soft constraints are those if we violate them in scheduling, the output is still valid, but hard constraints are those which if we violate them; the timetable is no longer valid. The search space of a timetabling problem is too vast, many solutions exist in the search space and few of them are not feasible. Feasible solutions here mean those which do not violate hard constraints and as well try to satisfy soft constraints. It is important to choose the most appropriate one from feasible solutions. Most appropriate ones here mean those which do not violate soft constraints to a greater extent. In this project, hard-constraints have been taken care of strictly and it has been ensured that soft-constraints are as well followed as much as possible.</p>
